# Excerpts of material I created for the [winter university on "Machine learning using python"](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/summer_university/winter_university_2022/machine_learning_using_python_theory_and_application) , that I lectured at TU Berlin together with my fellow friend Dennis Grinwald in 2021
---
